"MFADT17 inspo" (thesis 2017 blog)

Dumping ground for visual inspiration for my thesis project ("The Art of Motion"). 
Simple layout inspired by my favorite design blog: www.designspiration.com 

###Features
- Organized grid layout.
- Responsive sizing (mobile).
- Touch-screen recognition (mobile).
- Lightbox with smooth scrolling / arrows.
- Zoom and loading circle symbols for simple UI.

###Challenges
- Deleting / adding to blog directly.
- Video input / upload.
- Server communcation / hosting.

###Idea
By having an organized web-based place to put my inspiration, I can get that much closer to creating a solid visual identity for my thesis project. 

###Next Steps
- Add writing apsect to this thesis blog (for tracking project progress).
- Figuring out upload / delete commands directly on blog.
